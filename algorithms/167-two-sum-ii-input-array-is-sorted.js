 * Date  : 2018-07-25
 *
 * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two
 * numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum
 * should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target,
 * where index1 must be less than index2.
 *
 * Note:
 * Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not
 * use the same element twice.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
 * Output: [1, 2]
 * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
 *
 * Idea:
 *
 * We can still use the map structure to solve this problem, same as in problem 001.
 * We can also use abother appoach because the array is already sorted. Simply use
 * two pointers from start and end. Code explains.
