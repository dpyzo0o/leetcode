 *
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
 * Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 * Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must
 * be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 *
 * Idea:
 *
 * Use Map structure to store the mapping of character to its index. Keep two pointers
 * i and j, which form a sliding window. Increase the fast-runner j each time, if s[j]
 * exists in the window, let's say s[j']. Then move the slow-runner i to j' + 1.
 *
