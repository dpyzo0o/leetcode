 *
 * Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height
 * balanced BST. For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary
 * tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Given the sorted array: [-10, -3, 0, 5, 9],
 * One possible answer is: [0, -3, 9, -10, null, 5], which represents the following height
 * balanced BST:
 *
 *      0
 *     / \
 *   -3   9
 *   /   /
 * -10  5
 *
 *
 * Idea:
 *
 * A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose internal nodes each store a key
 * (and optionally, an associated value) and each have two distinguished sub-trees, commonly
 * denoted left and right. The tree additionally satisfies the binary search property, which
 * states that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the
 * left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree.
